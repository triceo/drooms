/**
 * Provide a common ground for various types of games. We introduce a couple of
 * concepts and let the implementing classes specify the rules around those
 * concepts. The following concepts will be shared by all games extending this
 * class:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>Each player gets one worm. Properties of these worms come from the game config and will be explained later. List
 * of players comes from the player config.</li>
 * <li>When a worm collides with something, it is terminated. Collisions are determined by classes extending this one.</li>
 * <li>When a worm's past couple decisions were all STAY (see {@link Action}), the worm may be terminated. This is
 * controlled by the classes extending this one.</li>
 * <li>When a turn ends, worms may be rewarded for surviving. How and when, that depends on the classes extending this
 * one.</li>
 * <li>Terminated worms will disappear from the playground in the next turn.</li>
 * <li>In each turn, a collectible item of a certain value may appear in the playground. These collectibles will
 * disappear after a certain amount of turns. Worms who collect them in the meantime will be rewarded. How often, how
 * valuable and how persistent the collectibles are, that depends on the classes extending this one.</li>
 * <li>Upon collecting an item, the worm's length will increase by 1.</li>
 * <li>Game ends either when there are between 0 and 1 worms standing or when a maximum number of turns is reached.</li>
 * <li>At the end of the game, a player whose worm has the most points is declared the winner.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Some of the decisions can be made by classes extending this one. These are clearly described above. This class
 * depends on properties as defined in {@link GameProperties}.
 * </p>
